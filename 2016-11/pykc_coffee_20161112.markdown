## PythonKC News

### PythonKC Organizer Search
* Python expertise is _not_ a requirement.
    * Organizer tasks have almost _nothing_ to do with Python skills.
    * Finding meeting space and lining up presentations don't require writing code.
* Being an organizer is _not_ a huge time commitment.
    * Mostly it's just _showing up_.
    * No current organizer is stepping down.
* We're _still_ looking for other interested people.
